= Tritium Project
An open source RISC based balanced ternary computer research project

== This is a research project
This project is not fully intended to get a perfectly functional computer out to the market, but rather, it is intended to get the concept of ternary computing out to the public so more people will start researching ternary computing as an alternative to binary computing. 

== What does balanced ternary mean?
Normal computers process data in binary which means two states, a one and a zero. Ternary is similar except operating on three states. In balanced ternary, there is a negative (i), neutral (0), and positive (1) which means numbers are naturally signed thus simplifying the architecture and general logic. Ternary also has the best radix efficiency for any integer base of 1.0046 where binary is 1.0615 with base e, 1.0000 being the most efficient. A 'trit' is the ternary analogue of a bit which stores an i (-1), 0, or 1. 

== Has this been done before?
There are many projects similar to this but they either haven't gone very far, closed source and secretive, or dead. The main inspiration for this project is the Russian Setun computer, more specifically the Setun-70 which has an 18 trit word and 81 words of memory with a magnetic drum holding more memory. 

== Directory Structure
* docs - contains documentation on the project and lab results
* kicad - contains the kicad project files for each part
** components - contains all complex multigate circuits
** gates - contains all ternary gates and their panelized PCBs
** logic - contains logical schematics of circuits using logic gates instead of transistors
* library - contains all of the kicad libraries such as the footprints, spice models, and symbols

== Possible final computer variants
=== Tritium-6
A 6-trit computer that is cheap and simple to make where the instructions more closely resemble microcode rather than instructions.

==== Design Goals
* Around or less than $500 in components
* Have the ability to communicate with binary components
* Use easily sourcable parts
* One clock cycle per instruction

=== Tritium-27
A full scale computer that mirrors RISC-V 32-bit in capability and instruction set.

==== Design Goals
* Around or less than $2000 in components
* Have the ability to communicate with binary components
* Use easily sourcable parts

== Current Status
The project is in a bit of a limbo due to the lack of funding I have for the project. I've been going to a college and all of my money and resources has been going into that. I'm currently looking for possible funding sources I have for the project so I can continue developing it.
