## Project Overview

This project is born out of necessity for efficiency. For my personal 3D printer, I have an Ender 3 that interfaces with my computer through a well-known Raspberry Pi program: OctoPrint. Within the various protocols of Octoprint is a great video streaming feature for keeping track of the 3D printer regardless of distance from the printer. With that in mind, I thought I'd take it one step further: Why not have a smart mirror that you can ask, much like a Google Home or Amazon Alexa, for the status? Additionally, what if this mirror were able to service a whole Maker Studio of printers, allowing you to see printer "A" or printer "B" with just a short request? It seems like a fun IOT project, and I'm excited to see where this idea goes!

## Educational Value Added

I am learning how to wield the IOT, webhook, and local host protocols to leverage into a portal of control that is easy to interface with for a wide variety of products (in this case, 3D printers). This device could extend its functionality into smart home environments. 
This project is being conducted, primarily, to learn how to develop with interconnected devices. Looking at the smart home market today, companies like Google and Amazon have started to augment their voice control interfaces (Amazon Echo and Google Home) with interfaces to "show"  (Amazon Echo Show, Google Nest Hub) data. My feeling is that these devices give users a multi-media experience of their data (visual and auditory). However, these devices are locked within their companies supporting environments, and not completely open to developers. By working on this project, I want to be able to create a completely open-source piece of hardware that works with IOT to provide smart home functionality, all while using a Google Home or Amazon Alexa to interface and control its screen. This would make it a Swiss Army Knife of a device, which I would be very interested to see.
