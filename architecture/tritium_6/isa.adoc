|Name   |Opcode |Type   |Description
|crr    |iii    |C      |Reads control register `addr` to register `rdest`
|crw    |ii0    |C      |Writes contents of register `rsrc` to control register `addr`
|spi    |ii1    |S      |Increments stack pointer
|spd    |i0i    |S      |Decrements stack pointer
|wsp    |i00    |S      |Writes contents of `rsrc` to memory address of the stack pointer. Does not increment stack pointer
|rsp    |i01    |S      |Reads contents of the memory address stack pointer to `rdest`. Does not decrement stack pointer
|lia    |i1i    |I      |Loads immediate value `imm` to register `A`
|lib    |i10    |I      |Loads immediate value `imm` to register `B`
|lic    |i11    |I      |Loads immediate value `imm` to register `C`
|sia    |0ii    |I      |Writes immediate value `imm` to memory address stored in register `A`
|sib    |0i0    |I      |Writes immediate value `imm` to memory address stored in register `B`
|sic    |0i1    |I      |Writes immediate value `imm` to memory address stored in register `B`
|cp     |00i    |R      |Copies contents from register `rsrc1` to `rdest`
|ld     |000    |R      |Loads contents from memory address `rsrc1` to register `rdest`
|st     |001    |R      |Stores contents from register `rsrc1` to memory address `rdest`
|jmp    |01i    |R      |Jumps to `rdest` if `rsrc1` depending on the single trit value of `rsrc2` (i jump if less than 0, 0 jump if equal zero, 1 jump if greater than zero)
|shl    |010    |R      |Sets `rdest` to the value of `rsrc1` tritshifted left by the unsigned value + 1 of `rsrc2` 
|shr    |011    |R      |Sets `rdest` to the value of `rsrc1` tritshifted right by the unsigned value + 1 of `rsrc2` (Not the value stored in the register)
|add    |1ii    |R      |Adds `rsrc1` and `rsrc2` to `rdest`
|addc   |1i0    |R      |Adds `rsrc1` and `rsrc2` with carry to `rdest`
|cmp    |1i1    |R      |Tritwise compares `rsrc2` to `rsrc2`, i if less than, 0 if equal, 1 if greater
|min    |10i    |R      |Ternary min `rsrc1` and `rsrc2`
|max    |100    |R      |Ternary max `rsrc1` and `rsrc2`
|inv    |101    |R      |Ternary inverts only `rsrc1`
|cons   |11i    |R      |Ternary consensus `rsrc1` and `rsrc2`
|any    |110    |R      |Ternary any `rsrc1` and `rsrc2`
|sign   |111    |R      |Returns the sign of only `rsrc1`, i if negative, 0 if 0, 1 if positive
