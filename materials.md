N Channel Enchantment MOSFET - 2N7002  
P Channel Enchantment MOSFET - BSS84  
Moving to replace the 2N7002 and BSS84 with the BSS8402DW which is a cmos mosfet that combines both the 2N7002 and BSS84 in one package

First ALU will use 6 74HC166 shift registers for input, an ATTiny10 for logic, and 3 74HC164 for output since it is cheaper and better for prototyping

Registers might use another microcontroller to save on cost and aid in prototyping
