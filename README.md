## Current Status

IN PROGRESS

## Project Overview

The project aims to build a simple 6-trit ternary computer using CMOS gates. The basic ternary gates using CMOS logic but a full open-source computer built from these gates has not been done yet. The computer will support 12-trit addressing to allow 531441 trytes of address space. 

I've already built out the basic gates and tested them using a multimeter, Tektronix 2245A, and Meanwell RT-50A power supply. I had some prototypes throughout the years of the components but never had the funding to fully built out a computer.

## Educational Value Added

Balanced ternary computing is not studied by many computer engineers or computer scientists. Building a simple balanced ternary computer would allow students study balanced ternary computing and mathematics.

## Tasks

<!-- Your Text Here. You may work with your mentor on this later when they are assigned -->

1. Clean up the current repository
2. Validate all of the gates with an oscilloscope to ensure they match the ngspice simulations
3. Create the ISA for the computer
4. Create the block diagram for the computer
5. Fill in the schematics for each block of the computer
6. Order bulk panels of each gate
7. Assemble computer on top of proto-board

## Design Decisions

6-trits was chosen to balance cost and usability. Older CPUs has 8-bit architectures with 16-bit addressing. A 6-trit architecture with 12-bit addressing helps balance out the cost, complexity, and capability.
